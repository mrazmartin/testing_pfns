run `make install` to install the required libraries.

It will also attempt to install PFNs from GitHub,
in case that fails, you can also make the installation by hand by running these commands in sequence in the current folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/automl/PFNs.git
cd PFNs
pip install -e .
```

! Make sure that you have installed the pfns module !
